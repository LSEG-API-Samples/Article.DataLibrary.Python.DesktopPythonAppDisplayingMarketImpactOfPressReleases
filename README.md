# Article.DataLibrary.Python.DesktopPythonAppDisplayingMarketImpactOfPressReleases
In this article, we'll create an application that will display statistics of an instrument immediately after a press release (eg: United States' Consumer Price Index (CPI) or US Non Farm Payroll) that can run in CodeBook. This way, you can have such a view on one side of your Workspace, and any other app of choice on the other. We'll display a live, interactive graph of the tick data, and a static table of the historical report data.
